# Absenteeism-time-in-hours
Every work place can't help but have workers who, depending on various reasons, decide to be absent. Why is that? Is there a more recurring reason across various subjects?

According to Forbes, Absenteeism is an employeeâ€™s intentional or habitual absence from work where excessive absences can equate to decreased productivity and can have a major effect on company finances, morale and other factors. There are different types of reasons that can lead to an absence at work such as Illness, Childcare, etc. 

This project will be looking at a dataset from Brazil where records of absenteeism at work were collected from July 2007 to July 2010 at a courier company. The goal is **to reduce worker absenteeism and evaluate the primary causes of absenteeism**. 

A few questions to consider along the way:

* Which areas of life affect Abseenteeism(i.e: Work or Family..)?

* Is there an obvious relationship between reason for absence and absenteeism?
